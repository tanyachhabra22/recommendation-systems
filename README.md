Recommendation Systems
Overview

Techniques Implemented
Knowledge/Rank-Based Recommendation System

Recommends top-rated or popular items based on predefined rules.
Similarity-Based Collaborative Filtering

User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items by identifying users with similar preferences.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items similar to those already interacted with.
Matrix Factorization-Based Collaborative Filtering

Uses techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to uncover latent relationships between users and items.
