Book Recommendation System
Description
This project implements a book recommendation system using collaborative filtering. It leverages user-item interactions to recommend books based on the preferences of similar users. The goal is to suggest personalized book recommendations to users, helping them discover new books based on their reading history or preferences.

The system uses the Surprise library for collaborative filtering and the Books dataset containing information about books, authors, and user ratings.
